# Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the **Data_Structure_Algorithm** repository! This repository is dedicated to providing clear, hands-on implementations and explanations of fundamental data structures and algorithms (DSA), which form the backbone of computer science and efficient programming.

## üìö What is DSA?

**Data Structures** are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. **Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Together, DSA enables developers to write optimized code for real-world applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

This repository covers core DSA topics, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays & Strings:** Basics of storing sequences, searching, and manipulation.
- **Linked Lists:** Singly, Doubly, and Circular lists for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions.
- **Stacks & Queues:** Linear data structures for LIFO/FIFO operations, including implementation via arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees:** Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Heap structures for hierarchical data storage and fast search.
- **Graphs:** Representation (adjacency list/matrix), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and shortest path algorithms.
- **Hashing:** Hash tables, collision resolution, and efficient lookup.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and their complexities.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Linear Search, Binary Search, and search in data structures like trees/graphs.
- **Recursion & Backtracking:** Solving problems by breaking them into subproblems, and exploring all solutions.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Breaking problems into overlapping subproblems for optimization.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Making locally optimal choices for global optimization.

> *Note: Some topics may be found in subdirectories named after the data structure or algorithm (e.g., `/Stack/`, `/Tree/`, `/Sort/`). For a full list, please browse the repository folders.*
